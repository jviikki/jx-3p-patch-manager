INSTALLATION AND USAGE:


INSTALLATION:

To install the utility, simply download the precompiled binary package and unzip it into a folder of your choice. If you want to look at the source code and compile the utility yourself, download the source archive, unzip it, and have fun.


USAGE:

This utility is intended for use as a command-line tool, meaning the user will need to execute the program in a command shell window (see the documentation for your operating system for how to do this). Open a command window, change to the directory where the executable file lives, and execute with the following command:

	decode_patches <wavfilename>

Some operating systems (like some versions of Windows, for instance) will allow the user to drag-and-drop the tape dump audio file onto the executable icon. A command window will pop up, the tool will do its work, and if there are any errors in decoding, the window will remain open so you can read the error messages. On successful completion, the patch parameters will be in a spreadsheet in the file “patchdump.csv”.


AUDIO PREPARATION:

For best results, you will need to take some care in preparing your tape audio file. Record your tape dump in the audio editor of your choice (directly from the JX-3P tape jack, if possible), trim any noise and silence before the beginning and after the end of the dump signal, amplify/normalize to the proper amplitude (between -12dB and -1dB), and save the file.

    - Bit depth: 8, 16, 24 bits are supported (16 bits is optimal)
    - Sample rate: 44.1 KHz is most suitable, but 22.1 KHz should work, too.
    - Channels: The tool works best with mono only. If a stereo file is used, the tool will use only the left channel and ignore the rest.
    - Format: Any format supported by LibSndFile is supported; this includes Microsoft PCM/WAV, Apple AIFF, and Sun AU.
    - Volume: for best results, amplify or normalize the dump audio to an average amplitude of between -12dB and -1dB. Do not clip the audio. If it is too quiet, the logic won’t detect the signal.
    - Source recording: best results are obtained by directly recording the dump audio by connecting the JX-3P tape out jack to your workstation’s audio interface. Decoding audio previously stored on magnetic tape is currently untested and not guaranteed to work due to the excess noise, dropouts, jitter, stretch, and preemphasis compression inherent in tape recording and playback.
